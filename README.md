Diabetes is the world's fourth leading cause of death, as well as a cause of renal disease,
blindness, and heart disease. Data mining techniques assist doctors in making accurate
diagnoses and treating diseases, reducing the workload of specialists. The goal of this study
was to use data mining techniques to predict diabetes. In the model we used various types of
data modelling techniques which helped us compare to different models and achieve better
results.
Dataset Description
The data was taken from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The dataset's goal is to diagnose whether a patient has diabetes using diagnostic
metrics included in the collection.The selection of these cases from a wider database was
subjected to many limitations. All of the patients at this clinic are Pima Indian women who
are at least 21 years old.There are various medical predictor factors in the dataset, as well as
one goal variable, Outcome.The pregnancies number the patient has had, their BMI, insulin
level, age, and other factors are all variables predictor .There are 768 records and 9 features
columns in the our dataset.Each feature can be either be integer or float data type and Some
features have zero values which represent missing values in data.
